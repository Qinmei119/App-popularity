# App-popularity
This project is to predict the app popularity for the apps from google app store by analyzing the influential factors for the popularity. 

## Context
While many public datasets (on Kaggle and the like) provide Apple App Store data, there are not many counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web. On digging deeper, I found out that iTunes App Store page deploys a nicely indexed appendix-like structure to allow for simple and easy web scraping. On the other hand, Google Play Store uses sophisticated modern-day techniques (like dynamic page load) using JQuery making scraping more challenging.

## Content
Each app (row) has values for catergory, rating, size, and more.

## Acknowledgements
This information is scraped from the Google Play Store. This app information would not be available without it.
